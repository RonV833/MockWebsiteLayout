# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]. This is  a mock up website layout using React Js and Material UI.
## Dependencies
To make sure everything run smoothly, just make sure to download all the material ui
@emotion/react, @emotion/styled, @material-ui/core , @material-ui/icons , @mui/material 
at your local if you will not clone this.
Other dependencies used includes, react-router-dom and react dom

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Additional Concerns`

This is still part of my lerning phase on working with react apps, if you have any suggestions for more efficient way to proceed with
my codes, you could message me via my email at ronv833@gmail.com. Thank you.
